# HelloFresh Mobile DevOps Test

Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to try our mobile devOps test. The goal of this test is to assess your coding and automation skills. You're given a simple task, so you can focus on showcasing your techniques.

Note: While we love open source here at HelloFresh, please do not create a public repo with your test in! This challenge is only shared with people interviewing, and for obvious reasons, we'd like it to remain this way.

## Problem definition

Under this repository, you will find one Android codebase and one iOS codebase. Each codebase contains a sample app along with a small suite of unit tests.

The aim of the test is to automate the process of building and running the included test suite in **one of the applications** and gather the results into a JSON format that can be printed to an output file or to a standard output.

## Acceptance Criteria:

When invoked, your automation:

-   compiles and runs the unit test suite from whichever app codebase you design it to run against.
-   collects the data from the test suite execution and transforms it into a JSON summary.
-   writes the JSON summary either to a standard output or to a file.
    

## Instructions

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Create a new ```dev``` branch.
3.  Solve the task and commit your code. Commit often. We like to see small commits that build up to the end result of your test instead of one final commit with all the code.
4.  Create a pull request from ```dev``` branch to ```main``` branch. Make sure to write about your approach in the description.
5.  Send the link via email to our HR department so we can start reviewing your code.
    

### Tips on How to Tackle the test

-   We don't expect you to spend more than four hours on this test.
-   Read this page carefully and feel free to ask any questions you might have.
-   You can choose whichever tools you believe are appropriate for fulfilling the acceptance criteria stated above.
-   Try to optimize your solution in a way that makes it understandable and maintainable.
-   Create a small README that documents your solution by describing what decisions you made when designing it, how to run it, what sort of things can go wrong, and information about the data you choose to include in the output.
